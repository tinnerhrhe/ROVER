This is the official repository for the paper [Random Policy Valuation is Enough for LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17618). This repository currently contains code for environment setup, training, and evaluation.

üöÄ We propose <u>**R**</u>andom P<u>**o**</u>licy <u>**V**</u>aluation for Di<u>**v**</u>erse <u>**R**</u>easoning (**ROVER**), a minimalist and highly effective RL method for LLM reasoning, achieving superior optimality and diversity by evaluating uniform-policy Q-values.


### üèÜ Main Results and Features
<img width="1217" alt="image" src="./teaser.png" />
<em>Figure 1: (a) ROVER achieves superior performances in terms of both pass@1 and pass@256 (trained on Qwen3-8B-Base averaged over AIME24, AIME24 and HMMT25 tasks). (b) Illustrative example demonstrating that ROVER achieves high-quality solutions with a lightweight procedure (see Table below for details) while maintaining diversity. (c) ROVER achieves higher diversity.</em> <br>
<br>
ROVER needs minimal GPU memory and computation cost, leaving more space for the KV cache. This allows ROVER to run on smaller memory setups and speeds up training:

| Method       | Memory Usage of Model Parameters                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ROVER (Ours) | **Low**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(actor model ONLY!üòä)                |
| GRPO         | **Medium** (actor + reference model)            |
| PPO          | **High**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(actor + reference + critic model)   |

### üîß Installation

This work considers two tasks for training and evaluating ROVER, which are countdown games for fine-grained analysis and more complex math reasoning tasks. Therefore, this project uses two separate environments for different tasks.

- For countdown tasks, you can follow the commands below:
```
cd Countdown
conda create -n rover-countdown python=3.9
pip3 install vllm==0.6.3
pip3 install ray
# verl
pip install -e .
# flash attention 2
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install wandb IPython matplotlib
```
- For math tasks:
```
cd Math
conda create -n rover-math python=3.12
pip install -e ./verl
pip install -e ./
pip install transformers==4.51.0
pip install vllm==0.8.4
pip install tensordict==0.6.2
 
```

### üéØ Training
- For training a model to solve the countdown task, please download [Qwen2.5-3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B) and then set the model path in [`run.sh`](./Coundown/scripts/run.sh), and then try:
```
conda activate rover-countdown
cd Countdown
bash ./scripts/run.sh
```
- For math tasks, please download [Qwen3-8B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base) model, and then try:
```
conda activate rover-math
cd Math
./scripts/deepscaler/train/rover_qwen3_8b.sh --model /path/to/qwen3-8b --wandb_api_key your_wandb_api_key
```
### üîé Evaluation
- Regarding the countdown task, you can follow the commands below to test the model's performance on the test set:
```
conda activate rover-countdown
cd Countdown
bash ./scripts/generate.sh
```
Note that before running the generation commands, you should first set the `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR`, `MODEL_BASE_PATH`, and `TEST_DATA_PATH` in the `generate.sh`.

- For math tasks, you can rollout on test set (use AIME24 as an example) and compute pass@$k$ as follows:
```
conda activate rover-math
cd Math
bash ./gen_eval_pipeline.sh /path/to/trained/model AIME2024
python passk_comparison.py
```
